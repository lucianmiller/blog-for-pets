  <h1>My pets</h1>
  <p>I have 5 pets in total. Two dogs, two pigeons and one cat.</p>
  
  <h2> My dogs</h2>
  <p>We got our dogs as puppys! They're more of my moms dogs, but I love them just the same. Their names are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bailey</li>
    <li>Benji</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Baliey is a shih tzu. He has a ressessive gene that gives him shorter fur then usual. He is a pure bread though, he just doesn't look like one! Because he's a shih tzu, he likes to cuddle all day rather then play.</p>
  <p>Benji is some sort of mutt. We think he's part Brittney, but we're not super sure. He has an under bite which causes him to have a hard time eating, but he's learned to slow down. Benji is super hyper but also scared of his own shadow.</p>

  <h3>My Rock Pigeons</h3>
  <p>I also have two pigeons I rescued as chicks. There names are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strix</li>
    <li>Greckles</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I named them after characters from D&D podcasts. They both mean bird in some way or another, which I didn't know until later, so I named both of my birds, Bird on accedent.</p>
  <p>My friend found them by the entrence to a Office Depo where they apparently had been sitting all day with no parent in sight. We tried to give them over to a wildlife sanctuary, but apparently all the pigeons you see around city's (which are normaly rock pigeons) are decendence from domestic pigeons that escaped, and because they aren't technecly wild and also not from the United States, wildlife rescuse can't take them. In the end, they ended up with me since they fledged too early, they ended up with me. They aren't the biggest fans of me, but they appricate the easy food and everything!</p>
  
  <h3>My Cat</h3>
  <p>I also have a cat! My boyfriend's sister got stuck with kittens from her friend, and I was able to adopt one! I haven't had a cat in years because my brother and step dad are allergic. She stays with my boyfriend as I'm not sure what's going on with my living situation at the moment, but I love her very much. Her name is Satan, as she wasn't super nice as a kitten according to my boyfriends sister, but she's warmed up to everyone and now won't let you get up if you're petting her!</p>
