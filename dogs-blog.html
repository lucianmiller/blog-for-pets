  <h1>Here is everything you'll need to know about my dogs!</h1>
  
  <h2>Names</h2>
  <p>Their names are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Benji</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bailey</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>A little about them</h3>
  <p>We got our dogs as puppys! They're more of my moms dogs, but I love them just the same.</p>
  <p><em>Bailey</em>
     is a shih tzu. He has a ressessive gene that gives him shorter fur then usual. He is a pure bread though, he just doesn't look like one! Because he's a shih tzu, he likes to cuddle all day rather then play.</p>
  <p><em>Benji</em> is some sort of mutt. We think he's part Brittney, but we're not super sure. He has an under bite which causes him to have a hard time eating, but he's learned to slow down. Benji is super hyper but also scared of his own shadow.</p>
