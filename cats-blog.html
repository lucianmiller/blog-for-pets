  <h1>Name</h1>
  <p>My cats name is <strong>Satan</strong>. She got this name by being sort of mean as a kitten. She's very friendly now!</p>

  <h2>A little about Satan</h2>
  <p>My boyfriend's sister got stuck with kittens from her friend, and I was able to adopt one! I haven't had a cat in years because my brother and step dad are allergic. She stays with my boyfriend as I'm not sure what's going on with my living situation at the moment, but I love her very much. She is very playful, and acts like more of a dog then a cat sometimes. She love to cuddle and meow loudly until she gets the attention she craves. Satan never really out grew her name. She's friendly to people, but she can still pack a punch when another cat or a dog comes near her.</p>
